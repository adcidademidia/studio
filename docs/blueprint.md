# **App Name**: StreamDeck Lower Thirds

## Core Features:

- Manual Lower Third Input: Allows users to manually enter title and subtitle information for the lower third.
- Automatic Lower Third from Planning Center: Fetches data from the Planning Center API (https://developer.planning.center/docs/#/apps/services) based on a provided plan link and maps data to title and subtitle fields.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2), evoking trust and dynamism, appropriate for a modern streaming tool.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E0F7FA) to provide a clean backdrop that doesn't distract from the overlay content.
- Accent color: A contrasting orange (#F7941D) to highlight interactive elements and important information, analogous to blue but with higher visibility.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font, for a modern, computerized aesthetic.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif font, for clear, readable text.
- Use simple, clear icons for settings and actions.
- Clean, intuitive layout with a focus on usability.
- Smooth slide-in and fade-in animations for the lower third display.
